        Welcome! I'm a software developer who primarily works in Ruby on Rails on the backend, React on the frontend,
        and Elixir when I want to do functional programming. I also do hybrid mobile development with React&nbsp;Native and Ionic.
        Over the course of my career, I've worked with a lot more languages than that; I've done projects in Angular,
        vanilla JavaScript, NodeJS, C#, Visual Basic, Haskell, and Python. I even worked on a&nbsp;
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUMPS">MUMPS</a> database for a while &ndash; seriously, I'll use any language
        if it's called for. Have a look at my <Link to="/resume">resume</Link> if you want to learn more about my career.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.intro}>
        When I'm not programming, I'm probably having fun with one of my many hobbies. I collect license plates, and&nbsp;
        <Link to="/license-plates">a section of this website</Link> is dedicated to my collection. I also enjoy travel,
        and one of my goals in life is to visit all of the 3,100+ counties in the United States.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.intro}>
        If you're interested in my thoughts on programming, my hobby-related adventures, or just what I've been up to,
        feel free to take a look at my <Link to="/blog">blog</Link>.
